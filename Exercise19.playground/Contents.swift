//  Create a structure with a mutating method
//  At Little Lemon, customers can book table reservations in various ways. You are tasked with creating a structure to hold the booking information for each person, including their name and the table number. It should also be possible to update the personâ€™s name to accommodate any booking changes.

struct TableReservation {
  var name: String
  var tableNumber: Int

  mutating func updateBooking(updatedName: String) {
    name = updatedName
  }
}

var johnBooking = TableReservation(name: "John", tableNumber: 1)
print(johnBooking)
johnBooking.updateBooking(updatedName: "Maria")
print(johnBooking)
