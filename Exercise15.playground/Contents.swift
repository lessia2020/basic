//  Use functions to modularize a program

//  The protagonist pirate is looking to spend the accumulated gold bars. After spending the gold bars, players want to be notified of the remaining gold bars. To achieve this, youâ€™ll write a function with a completion handler.

var goldBars = 100

func spendTenGoldBars(from inventory: inout Int, completion: (Int) -> Void) {
    inventory -= 10
    completion(inventory)
}

print("You had \(goldBars) gold bars.")


spendTenGoldBars(from: &goldBars) { goldBars in
    print("You spent ten gold bars")
    print("You have \(goldBars) gold bars.")
}
