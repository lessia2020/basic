//  Imagine you are creating a weather app that computes daily and weekly temperatures. You will use constants and variables to define the temperature of the current day of the week and the average temperature for that week.
//  Working with constants and variables


let day = "Monday"
let dailyTemperature = 75

print("Today is \(day).")
print("The temperature on \(day) is \(dailyTemperature)째F")

var temperature = 80
print("The temperature on \(day) is \(temperature)째F")
print("The temperature on \(day) evening is \(temperature)째F.")

var weeklyTemperature = 75
temperature = weeklyTemperature
print("The average temperature this week is \(temperature)째F.")
